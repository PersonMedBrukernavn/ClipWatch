# ClipWatch
A small program that will display a notification when the clipboard gets updated.\
No longer will you paste the wrong thing when Ctrl-C doesn't work!

## Usage
There's no configuration required, just start the execureable and it will run in the background.\
By clicling on the icon that appears in the system tray, you can change how the program works, or quit the program.

To make the program automatically start when you log in, simply put the executeable (or create a shortcut) in `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

## Requirements
- Windows Vista, or newer (In theory, haven't tested it)
- 1MB RAM
